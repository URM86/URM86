## <div align="center"> I'm Ulises, I'm a Geographer & Data Scientist | Postdoc Researcher at the Laboratório Espaço Público e Direito à Cidade (LabCidade) of the Universidade de São Paulo.  I have been working with data science to transform raw disaster reports into geospatial data, developing automated extract, transform, load (ETL) processes in Python and R, as well as interactive dataviz..</div> 

- I love making maps, learning programming languages like R and Python, playing video games, playing the ukulele, drinking black coffee, and beer. 
During my undergraduate studies, I focused on Cartography and Remote Sensing. In my Master's degree, I specialized in Hydrology and Numerical Modeling (both Atmospheric and Hydrological).
- I have worked—and still work—in academia (teaching and conducting research), and since 2018, I’ve been gradually transitioning into Data Science, increasingly exploring R and Python.

- I have worked at institutions such as:
- The Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro (IPJB-RJ), where I helped develop Jabot, a system for managing scientific collections deposited in herbaria and laboratory networks, as well as living collections in botanical gardens. (https://jabot.jbrj.gov.br/v3/consulta.php)
- The Laboratório de Sistemas Avançados de Gestão da Produção (SAGE) at COPPE/UFRJ, where I participated in projects monitoring the Amazon Reef System, the Abrolhos Bank, and the disaster caused by the Mariana dam collapse in Minas Gerais (https://abrolhos.org/).
